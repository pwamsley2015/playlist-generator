# playlist-generator

So... I was going to make a fancy Music Client with smart Playlist Generatation and ordering, and then Apple music came along and made that idea pointless. 

What I did do was work on this fun start I had; the user can add Artist names and then create an iTunes playlist containing all their music from those artists (somehow iTunes doesn't have this feature). 

I implemented a custom AutoFill system, where the user can start typing an artist's name, such as "Arc" and then easily fill it in with "Arctic Monkeys." (think google auto fill). 

Not the most useful program, but occasially useful, and it was fun to make with lots of "Applescript from bash from java" hacking.
